# Earthquakes in the World

## Abstract

Various datasets are prepared to examine the relationship between various indices showing the development of countries and damage received from earthquakes. Many different visualization techniques are applied, and data is shown clearly. The relationship between the financial damage received from earthquakes with a magnitude of 8 to 9 and the energy consumption in the year of the earthquake is examined and the hypothesis of this is accepted. As we can see in our hypothesis, there is a relationship between energy consumption, which is one of the factors showing the level of development of countries, and damage from earthquakes. Known various indices showing the development of countries can provide foresight to the states in estimating earthquake damage.
